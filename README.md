# Bondora-Project
Analyzing Bondora's P2P lending data from 2009 to 2020, this project focuses on credit risk modeling for uncollateralized loans. It seeks to empower lenders in minimizing default risks and optimizing returns amidst information asymmetry, emphasizing rational decision-making in the dynamic P2P lending environment.
